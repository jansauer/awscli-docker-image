# AWS CLI + Docker Image

The hardest container image to find on dockerhub; So I build my own ðŸ¤ª

This image packs the [AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) 
together with the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).
This makes it possible to build docker images and push them to a
[Amazon ECR Repositories](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Repositories.html).
